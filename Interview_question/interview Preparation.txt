1. Tell me about yourself.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], thank you for this opportunity!

My name is Pruthviraj. I completed my 10th from St. Joseph High School and my 12th from Mahatma Phule College of Science. I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from Mumbai University and graduated with 74%.

I have a strong understanding of Java and Spring Boot, and I have worked on various projects that helped me build practical experience in backend development. I am also familiar with databases like MySQL.

In my final year, I worked on a crowdfunding platform using blockchain. It was a decentralized system designed to ensure transparency, security, and efficient fund management. The platform allowed seamless interaction between campaign creators, administrators, and users. We built it using Next.js, MySQL, and Smart Contracts with Solidity, and my role was to manage the backend by storing campaign details in the MySQL database.

Apart from that, I also developed a PathoCure Lab website, which enables users to book blood test appointments online. A lab technician visits the user’s location for sample collection, and reports are generated and delivered digitally within a week.

Coming to my achievements, I successfully cleared the NPTEL Java certification, conducted by IIT Kharagpur, and achieved the Elite level.

As for my career goals:

My short-term goal is to enter the field of Information Technology by securing a position where I can apply my skills effectively.

My long-term goal is to reach a level of proficiency where I can make key decisions that contribute to my company’s success.

In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket and coding, as I love solving real-world problems through technology.

Hi, My name is Pruthviraj.I am a 4th year BE IT student at Terna Engineering college . My primary interest lies in field of android. I started programming in C language when I was in first year and During my second year i got to know about java programming language, my experience with C has provided me with a good understanding of low-level programming concepts, memory management. This knowledge has seamlessly translated to Java, enabling me to write efficient and optimized code while taking advantage of Java's high-level abstractions and built-in libraries. One of the main differences I have noticed is that Java is an object-oriented programming language, whereas C is primarily procedural. However, this transition has been an exciting learning opportunity for me.  I have enjoyed exploring Java's powerful object-oriented features, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. I have also  build an desktop application in college project with my teamates . The familiarity with Java allowed me to quickly adapt to Android development, as both share a similar syntax and object-oriented principles." During my third year  I had the chance to work on practical web development projects. For instance, I collaborated with a team to develop a responsive website for a local organization.  I was responsible for implementing back-end  features using react,Express and mongodb.  This experience allowed me to understand the importance of writing clean and organized code. I have also participated in college hackthone where  I was genuinely curious about exploring Flutter in android development. My main objective was to get a taste of what Flutter could do and gain some initial exposure to the technology."
